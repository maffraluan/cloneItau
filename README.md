Clone Ita√∫ Banking mobile interface

I think the main layout is done. I won't depth about it. There's so many functionalities. 
API consumed and stuff. I made a file Helpers.ts that returns an Array simulating an API. 
Where one of those components could map it.

I used useNagivation hook from react-navigation. 


If you read the code you'll see styles.ts where I used styled-components and StyleSheet.create. 
Sometimes I use both. (I hope it has no problem)


PS: I made this clone based on IOS system. May not run as such friendly on Andriod system.
